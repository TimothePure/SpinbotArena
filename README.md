# SpinbotArena

SpinbotArena is a Unreal Engine project initially made among a student team at IIM Digital School during winter 2024. 
Initial project repo : https://github.com/julien-abr/SpinbotArenaV2

The goal of this repo is to rework the SpinbotArena project (mainly the codebase, I will reuse the assets) to integrate GAS and networking multiplayer that we could not implement during the 3 months of the project.
